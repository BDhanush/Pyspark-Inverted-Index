Penn’s Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) in Data Science prepares students for a wide range of data-centric careers, whether in technology and engineering, consulting, science, policy-making, or understanding patterns in literature, art or communications.

The Data Science Program can typically be completed in one-and-a- half to two years. It blends leading-edge courses in core topics such as machine learning, big data analytics, and statistics, with a variety of electives and an opportunity to apply these techniques in a domain specialization of choice.

The domain specialization offers both preparatory coursework and a thesis or practicum in a data science application area. Potential areas of specialization include network science (the Warren Center for Network and Data Science), digital humanities (the Price Lab for Digital Humanities), biomedicine (the Institute for Biomedical Informatics), and public policy (the Penn Wharton Budget Model and the Annenberg Center for Public Policy) — as well as more traditional opportunities in Computer and Information Science and Electrical and Systems Engineering. For students interested in applying data analysis and modeling to other areas within engineering and the physical sciences, Penn offers a specialized and synergistic program in Scientiﬁc Computing.
